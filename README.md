# React-Portfolio
A portfolio created with React that has an about me section, a portfolio section, contact information, and a resume.

## Description

Every job seeker needs a portfolio. This project was made with React as a way to practice what I've learned about using React components and deployment. It features an about page, a portfolio page, a contact page, and a resume page with a list of skills and a link to my resume. A single project component was built and rendered for each project in the portfolio, and can easily be added to if I wanted to feature more.
